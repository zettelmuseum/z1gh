# Slide 1 title

Some super quickly created demo slides

* Do not need anything else than markdown
    * Slides title starts with # (also starts a new slide)
    * Bullet points, newlines, empty lines: all standard markdown
* However, can also use other stuff, e.g.:
    * Some HTML (e.g. \<center\>)
    * When using pandoc beamer, can use latex commands (e.g. \\center, \\large, etc)\dots

# Slide 2 title

\center The slide syntax is so simple.
